== Description ==
Power Addon is one most powerful extensions for WPBakery Page Builder for WordPress (formerly Visual Composer) plug-in with more than 160 shortcodes and additions which can be used easily in any theme.

Except shortocdes options, we have added some extra options which make working with these shortcodes really easy. One the most powerful options that we have added is Prallax which is specifically added to row setting.

We considered an option, by default, to create demo pages with all features for you. This will let you see them all and use them in your theme. These pages will be created by installing your plug-in and you need no extra setting in this regard.

To create more professional shortcodes, we added some Custom Fields to them such as icon, border and etc to make using shortcodes easier to you and also to have a better display in UI (User Interface).

Power Addon with more than 9 icon packages and over 2000 icons has most powerful icon sets and icons are retina ready. You can easily manage and use them.

We worked on performance and SEO optimization of this plug-in and we load only essential files on pages. We make sure that the numbers of requests are as low as possible. We only load the necessary font families, font weights and color.
